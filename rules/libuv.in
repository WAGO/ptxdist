	  asynchronous event notification library - runtime library

	  Libuv is the asynchronous library behind Node.js. Very
	  similar to libevent or libev, it provides the main elements
	  for event driven systems: watching and waiting for
	  availability in a set of sockets, and some other events like
	  timers or asynchronous messages. However, libuv also comes
	  with some other extras like:

	  * files watchers and asynchronous operations
	  * a portable TCP and UDP API, as well as asynchronous DNS
	    resolution
	  * processes and threads management, and a portable
	    inter-process communications mechanism, with pipes and
	    work queues
	  * a plugins mechanism for loading libraries dynamically
	  * interface with external libraries that also need to access
	    the I/O.
