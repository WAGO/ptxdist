config DEBUG_PACKAGES
	bool
	prompt "create debug packages"
	help
	  If this is enabled, then for each package a debug package is
	  created. These packages are not installed by default but can be
	  installed manually as needed. They contain the debug files that
	  are otherwise only available in nfsroot.
	  This is useful to run debug tools such as gdb, valgrind, perf
	  etc. on a normal (not nfsroot) rootfs.
