	  libfaketime intercepts various system calls that programs use to
	  retrieve the current date and time. It then reports modified (faked)
	  dates and times (as specified by you, the user) to these programs.
	  This means you can modify the system time a program sees without
	  having to change the time system-wide.

	  libfaketime allows you to specify both absolute dates (e.g. 01/01/2004)
	  and relative dates (e.g., 10 days ago).

	  libfaketime might be used for various purposes, for example
	    - deterministic build processes
	    - debugging time-related issues, such as expired SSL certificates
	    - testing software for year-2038 compliance

	  libfaketime ships with a command line wrapper called "faketime" that
	  makes it easier to use, but does not expose all of libfaketime's
	  functionality. If your use case is not covered by the faketime command,
	  make sure to look in this documentation whether it can be achieved by
	  using libfaketime directly.
