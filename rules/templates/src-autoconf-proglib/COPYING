TODO: decide what kind of license your work should have:

 - LGPL:
   * http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.0.txt
   * http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt

 - GPL:
   * http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt
   * http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt

or any other license. But you should *always* include a valid license here.

Note: for the LGPL-3 case you must also include the GPL-3 license.
Note: you can define your library to use the LGPL-* license, while the program
      can use the GPL-*
