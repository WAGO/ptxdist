    Configure options
    -----------------

    Here is a list of configure options which are sometimes useful
    for installation.

     --disable-largefile
                     Switch off largefile support for small 32 bit machines.
                     May fail when NFS is used.

     --enable-debug
                     Make the library more noise and do more runtime checks.
                     This may slow down the library at runtime.

     --enable-profiling
                     Build the library with profiling support.

     --enable-code-coverage
                     Build the library with coverage support.

     --enable-abort
                     Use abort() instead of exit() in case of failures.
                     (advantage of abort() is to get a coredump for easier
                      debugging)

     --with-goal=<speed|secure>
                     Optimize for 'speed' or 'secure'. 'secure' enables more
                     compile-time security options, 'speed' disables them.

    <TODO add more switches on demand here>

    Environment Variables
    ---------------------

    You can overwrite CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS from the environment. But
    keep in mind to not forget to add the "-O2 -g", if you use your own CFLAGS
    settings. Only in the case CFLAGS is unset, configure defaults to "-O2 -g"
